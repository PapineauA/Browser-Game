        <p>In this game, you'll have to solve a mysterious murder, and then answer trivia-style questions to see if you
            really know who did it!
            You can do this by reading through the case files that the police have gathered and with your own insights
            see into the heart of what really occured!
            When you feel like you've figured out what happened, click the "Question Time" button to start the Trivia
            Game!
