# Browser-Game

First entry on my portfolio... a browser game made with HTML, CSS, and JS!

This game's inspiration comes from the fact that I love all types of mystery media (like books, movies, tv shows, etc...) so I figured why not make something like that for my first project. This game (at least at the time of this commit) should essentially boil down to reading about how certain crimes took place, and then answering questions to see if you've really figured out what happened!
