# Browser-Game

First entry on my portfolio... a browser game made with HTML, CSS, and JS!

This game's inspiration comes from the fact that I love all types of mystery media (like books, movies, tv shows, etc...) so I figured why not make something like that for my first project. This game (at least at the time of this commit) should essentially boil down to reading about how certain crimes took place, and then answering questions to see if you've really figured out what happened!

Outstanding bug: The total for the game isn't calculating exactly correctly. If you get everything right, it should be exactly right, but otherwise it won't count correctly.
The total increases by too much per evaluation, so on question 1, the evaluation is 1 point, and question 2, it awards 2 points for a total of 3, etc etc.
