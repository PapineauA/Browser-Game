        <p>In this game, you'll have to solve a mysterious murder, and then answer trivia-style questions to see if you
        really know who did it!
        You can do this by reading through the case files that the police have gathered and with your own insights
        see into the heart of what really occured!
        When you feel like you've figured out what happened, click the "Question Time" button to start the Trivia
        Game! During the trivia sections, click through whichever you think is the right answer, and click evaluate.
        Whatever the answer is, click next, evaluate, next until the quiz is over. Then click results to display your total
        score!
